<h1>Domain Controllers and Active Directory</h1></h1>
In this demonstration, a domain controller and DNS server are created on a virtual machine running Windows Server 2022. Once the VM has been commissioned as a server, Active Directory will be briefly explored. New organizational units and user accounts will be added and assigned permissions. Lastly, a separate Windows 11 VM located in the same virtual network will be added to the domain, and remote access will be authorized for all users.
